# Bitcoin Regtest Dashboard

A real-time web dashboard to monitor two Bitcoin nodes running in **regtest** mode. Visualizes blocks, transactions, mempool and network status — all from a single browser tab.

Built as part of the **[AFI Master in Data Science & AI](https://www.afiglobaleducation.com/master-fulltime/master-en-ciencia-de-datos-e-inteligencia-artificial) — Blockchain Analytics** practical workshop.

Both nodes online at block height 182, 1 peer each, with the last 20 blocks listed per node.

## What is this?

When developing or testing Bitcoin applications, you typically run local nodes in `regtest` mode — a private blockchain where you control everything. This dashboard gives you a live view of both nodes side by side:

- Block explorer with clickable transactions
- Real-time sync status between nodes
- Mempool monitoring
- Automatic polling (no page refresh needed)

**Why a backend server?** Browsers block direct RPC calls from a web page due to CORS and security policies. `server.py` acts as a local proxy, forwarding requests from the dashboard to each node using cookie-based authentication (`.cookie` files generated automatically by Bitcoin Core).

---

## Requirements

- **macOS** or **Linux** (Ubuntu/Debian, including WSL2 on Windows 11)
- **Bitcoin Core** (installed via the scripts below)
- **Python 3.9+** (no external dependencies — stdlib only)
- **Homebrew** (macOS only — https://brew.sh)

---

## Step-by-step guide

### Step 1 — Install Bitcoin Core

**macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/install-mac.sh
./scripts/install-mac.sh
```

This runs `brew install bitcoin` and creates the `~/bitcoin/node1` and `~/bitcoin/node2` directories.

**Linux / WSL2:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/install-linux.sh
./scripts/install-linux.sh
source ~/.bashrc   # reload PATH
```

This downloads Bitcoin Core 27.2, extracts it to `~/bitcoin-core`, adds it to your PATH, and creates the node directories.

> **Manual alternative:** Download the right binary for your platform from https://bitcoin.org/en/download

---

### Step 2 — Start the Bitcoin nodes

```bash
chmod +x scripts/start-nodes.sh
./scripts/start-nodes.sh
```

This starts two `bitcoind` processes in regtest mode, each with its own data directory and ports:

| Node  | P2P port | RPC port | Data directory        |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------------------|
| node1 | 1234     | 1234     | `~/bitcoin/node1`     |
| node2 | 2345     | 2345     | `~/bitcoin/node2`     |

You can verify the nodes are running with:
```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir="$HOME/bitcoin/node1" -rpcport=1234 getblockchaininfo
bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir="$HOME/bitcoin/node2" -rpcport=2345 getblockchaininfo
```

Both should show `"chain": "regtest"` and `"blocks": 0`.

> **Tip:** Open two extra terminal tabs running `tail -f ~/bitcoin/node1/regtest/debug.log` and `tail -f ~/bitcoin/node2/regtest/debug.log` to see live node activity throughout the exercise.

---

### Step 3 — Run the demo

Two modes are available depending on what you want to demonstrate.

#### Option A — Standalone demo (nodes isolated)

Runs the full exercise on **node1 only**, without connecting the nodes as peers. Node2 stays at block height 0 and is unaware of any transactions — even if node1 sends BTC to a node2 address.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/demo-standalone.sh
./scripts/demo-standalone.sh
```

Start the dashboard and compare the two panels side by side: node1 will show 102 blocks and a balance of ~49 BTC, while node2 shows height 0 and 0 BTC — even though node1 already sent it 1 BTC.

Now connect the nodes:

```bash
./scripts/connect-nodes.sh
```

Watch node2 in the dashboard: it will detect the longer chain on node1 and sync automatically, jumping from height 0 to 102 and showing its 1 BTC balance. This illustrates the core principle of Bitcoin's peer-to-peer consensus — **nodes always adopt the longest valid chain**.

#### Option B — Full demo (nodes connected from the start)

Runs the complete exercise with both nodes connected as peers from the beginning. Blocks and transactions propagate in real time as they are mined.

```bash
chmod +x scripts/demo.sh
./scripts/demo.sh
```

---

### Step 4 — Start the dashboard

```bash
chmod +x start.sh stop.sh
./start.sh
```

This starts `server.py` on port 18500 and opens `http://localhost:18500` in your browser.

![Block detail](<images/bitcoin-dashboard 2.png>)

Block #102 showing two transactions: the **coinbase** (50.00003525 BTC mined reward) and the **1 BTC payment** sent to node2's wallet, with 48.99996475 BTC returned as change.

### Step 5 — Stop everything

```bash
# Stop the dashboard
./stop.sh

# Stop the Bitcoin nodes
./scripts/stop-nodes.sh
```

Or individually:
```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=$HOME/bitcoin/node1 -rpcport=1234 stop
bitcoin-cli -regtest -datadir=$HOME/bitcoin/node2 -rpcport=2345 stop
```

## Dashboard features

### Per-node panels
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Status badge** | Online / Offline indicator |
| **Chain height** | Current block count |
| **Peers** | Number of connected peers |
| **Session blocks** | Blocks mined since dashboard opened |
| **Mempool** | Pending transaction count, refreshed every 10s |
| **Best block hash** | Full hash of the chain tip |

### Block list
- Last 20 blocks, newest first
- Columns: height · hash · timestamp · tx count · size
- **Click any block** to open the detail modal

### Block detail modal
- All block header fields: version, merkle root, bits, nonce, difficulty, weight
- Full transaction list — each transaction expandable showing:
  - All inputs (coinbase or `txid:vout`)
  - All outputs with address and BTC value

### Real-time updates
| Data | Polling interval |
|---|---|
| Node info (height, peers) | Every 3 seconds |
| Block list | Every 5 seconds |
| Mempool | Every 10 seconds |

New blocks flash orange when detected.

### Comparison panel
- Side-by-side table comparing both nodes
- Sync indicator: green if both nodes share the same tip block hash

## API endpoints

`server.py` exposes a local JSON API at `http://localhost:18500`:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Serves `index.html` |
| `GET /api/status` | Connection status of both nodes |
| `GET /api/node/{1\|2}/info` | `getblockchaininfo` + `getnetworkinfo` + `getmempoolinfo` |
| `GET /api/node/{1\|2}/blocks` | Last 20 blocks (summary) |
| `GET /api/node/{1\|2}/block/{hash}` | Full block with transactions (verbosity 2) |
| `GET /api/node/{1\|2}/mempool` | Mempool info + raw txid list |

---

## Configuration

Node config is at the top of `server.py`. Change ports or paths here if your setup differs:

```python
NODE_CONFIGS = [
    {"name": "node1", "rpchost": "127.0.0.1", "rpcport": 1234, "datadir": BITCOIN_DIR / "node1"},
    {"name": "node2", "rpchost": "127.0.0.1", "rpcport": 2345, "datadir": BITCOIN_DIR / "node2"},
]
```

Authentication uses Bitcoin Core's auto-generated `.cookie` files — no manual credential setup needed.
